Raspberry pi4 8G ram<br>
Arduino Mega 2650<br>
6 x BTS7960 Motor Drivers. One for each wheel, and one for each arm<br>
4 x arduino Nano. One for each arm, and 2 on the back-burner for the LEDs.<br>

Elecrow 5 inch LCD touch screen.<br>
Xbox Series X controller.<br>

XBox 360 depth camera for now. It's on the upgrade list (it's losing support in the open source community.)<br>
JBL Flip 5 for sound.


I've added "controllerboard" python script for Xbox Bluetooth controller.<br>
The "fingerboard" keyboard script has changed, but not for the better. I'm stripping it down. (mostly LED and sound stuff)<br>
The LEDs are not at the top of my list and are on the back-burner for now.<br>

Special thanks to Jim Reel who welded the main canopy for me. See you on the flip side.
